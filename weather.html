                            The weather here at IC can be challenging. In the Summer,
                            Spring, and early Fall, it can be hot and humid. In the Winter, 
                            there may be snow, ice, and even sub-zero temperatures. Not to 
                            mention less extreme conditions like rainy days and thunderstorms. 
                            Walking between cars, classes, and activites, being prepared for 
                            whatever conditions you might face is a must in college. Here, you 
                            can find live weather reports to help you make sure you're ready before
                            leaving your dorm each day, as well as an IC weather checklist, so you 
                            can be sure you're showing up to campus each semester with everything you'll
                            need.

                        <p class="article-content">A year here at IC might expose you to extremes on every end 
                            of the meteorological spectrum. Lucky for you, this checklist will 
                            help you approach each semester with the confidence that you're ready 
                            for whatever the year might throw at you.
                        </p>
                        <ul class="article-content">
                            <li class="fw-bold">Light Clothes</li>
                            <p>When you get here in the Fall, it's going to be hot out. And all 
                                the moisture evaporating off of corn fields will make the air as humid 
                                as the Mississippi delta. You're going to want some clothes to help you beat 
                                beat the heat
                            </p>
                            <li class="fw-bold">A Sturdy Umbrella</li>
                            <p>This might be the most important item on the list. The last thing you want is to wake 
                                up on a rainy day and have to walk across campus without an umbrella. 
                            </p>
                            <li class="fw-bold">Waterproof Shoes</li>
                            <p>Much like an umbrella, this is a must. You'll do a lot of walking on campus. And if you're 
                                caught in the rain with the wrong shoes, you'll do a lot of walking in swampy sneakers.
                            </p>
                            <li class="fw-bold">Fall Fashion</li>
                            <p>Fall can be a fun season, and the colors can be fun to dress up for. But the most important thing 
                                is to be prepared for the weather with a light jacket. You don't want to be shivering in fifty degrees, 
                                but you don't want to be sweating in a parka either
                            </p>
                            <li class="fw-bold">A Winter Coat</li>
                            <p>Not a hoodie, not a turtleneck, not a jacket. A winter coat. You might find yourself walking to class in sub-zero 
                                temperatures. So make sure you're ready to stay warm.
                            </p>
                            <li class="fw-bold">Winter Hat and Gloves</li>
                            <p>If you spend winter at IC, you'll find out you need these anyways, so its best to bring them and be prepared. You might 
                                not think your ears and hands will get that cold walking between classes. But you'd be wrong, and you don't want to find 
                                out the hard way.
                            </p>
                            <li class="fw-bold">Boots</li>
                            <p>Waterproof, tall boots. Have you ever had to walk half a mile with your shoes full of snow? If you have, 
                                you'll bring a pair of boots. If you haven't you'll buy a pair of boots. The only questions is whether you'll 
                                buy them before or after trying to trudge through the snow in your sneakers.
