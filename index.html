                            We're so glad you're here! That said, the truth is that this 
                            is really just placeholder text. I honestly just want to try and make
                            sure the BS library is doing what I want it to be doing. And that means I need to type 
                            out some text before I add an image in to the right of it. Anyways, I'm 
                            really glad you're here taking a look at my site. I'll hope to have it a bit more polished
                            for you soon!

                            <p>As a college student, dining can be a drag. Keeping 
                                track of meal schedules and menus can be pretty overwhelming.
                                Luckily, we have plenty of resources to make dining at IC as easy as 
                                one, two, three!
