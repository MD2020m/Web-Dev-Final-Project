                                Dining at school can take some getting used to. Balancing your 
                                schedule with your dining hall's schedule can be a challenge. And 
                                nothing is worse than going hungry because you were five minutes late 
                                for a meal. But for a little bit of help, look not further! Here, you can
                                find information such as the IC dining hall's meal schedule, other on-campus 
                                options, and even a few off-campus dining recomendations. Whether you're 
                                always on time, you've just missed a meal, or you're looking for something 
                                different, we've got you covered.
