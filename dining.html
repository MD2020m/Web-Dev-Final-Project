                            Dining at school can take some getting used to. Balancing your 
                            schedule with your dining hall's schedule can be a challenge. And 
                            nothing is worse than going hungry because you were five minutes late 
                            for a meal. But for a little bit of help, look not further! Here, you can
                            find information such as the IC dining hall's meal schedule, other on-campus 
                            options, and even a few off-campus dining recomendations. Whether you're 
                            always on time, you've just missed a meal, or you're looking for something 
                            different, we've got you covered.

                            <p>You'll probably get most of your meals at IC from
                                Cummings Dining Hall. The Dining Hall serves a few
                                buffet style meals each day. We can help make sure you're
                                always on time.

                                if you're free for lunch (and you don't mind a long line) 
                                you should stop by and give it a try.
